# Advent of code(s)
I have decided to tackle all *Advent of Code* calendars (https://adventofcode.com), beginning from 2015 all the way to 2019 (2020 will be in a seperate repository).  
Every year will be done in different languages to practice and learn new skills.

This repository keeps track of my progress. They are by no means good or fast solution, just a personal space, so I do not lose them.  
Please feel free to explore ;)
